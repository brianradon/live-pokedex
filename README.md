# live-pokedex

Live-Pokedex is a personal project that I used to learn how NodeJS and Express work, along with client side routing in ReactJS.  During this time, I also learned about asynchronous functionality.  It was a little project to mess around with a fun API, and the result was this Live Pokedex, which gives basic information (Name, ID, Sprite, and Types [Dual-Typing if applicable]) on ~700 pokemon in the form of a scrollable list.  You can select a pokemon from the list, and get a detailed view, including battle stats, a move list specific to that pokemon, and an updated image.
